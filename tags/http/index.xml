      <description>Hi guys. While I was working on the library for Telegram API. I ran into the problem of finding a good http-client library. Some libraries did not allow multipart/form-data requests. And in others it was necessary to form the body itself. I thought that this is a problem that I can solve. I wrote a library, which is a small http-client (less than 200 lines of code). There are still small problems in it.</description>
