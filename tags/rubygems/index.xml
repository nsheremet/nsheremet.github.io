      <description>Hi, guys! I decided to remove the ability to create resources. Because for ethical reasons it is better to use the concept of services. Since it is more suitable for the removal of business logic in services. Also the concept of services for wider use. And also since the implementation of resources and services was the same, it would be correct to leave only services.

Updated usage Run rails generate faat:services {service_name}, generator will create folder services in app directory, and file {service_name}_service.</description>

      <description>Faat! v0.1.5 As I wrote earlier, I am developing a gem-generator for the separation of the base rails logic to resources, services and forms. Today I released a new version of my gem Faat!-v0.1.5. And added the module services to separate the logic of your rails projects.
Now, you will see examples of working with service.
Example: Ok, we just generated new payment_service.rb:
class PaymentService &amp;lt; Faat::Services::Base def year_payment # .</description>
