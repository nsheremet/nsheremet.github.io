### Hi guys.

A few days ago I wrote post about my problem with http-client mgems in mruby.
There I described the work with my library `mruby-smallhttp`.
And this post got into Ruby Weekly 343, here is the [link](http://rubyweekly.com/issues/343).
I dont know how they found my post, but I need to say thanks to Ruby Weekly team.
